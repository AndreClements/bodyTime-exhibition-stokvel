# In Closing  
## Artist Statement

*bodyTime()*: Our bodies trace us, skimming time, unfurling presence through flesh and bone, skin, shadow, and the unseen we sometimes, just for an instant, might see.

## Advance Praise

> “…an opportunity to view the model from several points of view… wonderfully anachronistic…”  
> —Carl Jeppe

> “…overlayed exposures take me into an imaginary surreal erotic world…”  
> —Anton Uys

## Curatorial Background

From *bodyTime(fugitivity)*’s debut at The Sex Expo (Nov 29–Dec 1, 2024, Gallagher Estate) with Go Naked naturists, to *bodyTime()* at Stokvel Gallery, Melville (March 15–16, 2025)—16 prints, finite here, unique editions printed on PFR 220 Fineart Rag (Monocrome pigment on Archival Acid-Free). Gratitude to Gordon Froud for Stokvel’s raw walls, Sammy Muller for her opening words, and all who embraced this softly unfolding vision.
