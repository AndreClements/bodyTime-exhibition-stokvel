# In Closing  
## Artist Statement
*bodyTime()*: Our bodies trace us, skimming time, unfurling presence through flesh and bone, skin, shadow, and the unseen we sometimes, just for an instant, might see, might be.

## Advance Praise
“You give the viewer an opportunity to view the model from several points of view; clearly, it takes time to look at anything or anyone from different angles in different poses, so you present that opportunity to the viewer.  Wonderfully anachronistic, showing us glimpses in black-and-white that remind us of Duchamp’s “nude descending a staircase”, Balla’s futurism, Boccioni’s “Unique forms of continuity in Space” and Edweard Muybridge’s Studies in motion.”  
—Carl Jeppe

“...everything about these are quite something . The overlayed exposures take me into an imaginary surreal  erotic world. Controversial french psychologist, (post Freud) Jacques Lacan comes to mind.”  
—Anton Uys

## Curatorial Background
From *bodyTime(fugitivity)*’s debut at The Sex Expo (29 Nov to 1 Dec 2024, Gallagher Estate) with Go Naked naturists, to *bodyTime()* at Stokvel Gallery, Melville (15 to 16 March 2025)—16 prints, finite here, unique editions printed on PFR 220 Fineart Rag (monochrome pigment on archival acid-free stock).

## Thanks
Gratitude to Gordon Froud for Stokvel’s walls and roof, Sammy Muller for her opening words, and all who embraced this softly unfolding vision. And most of all to the participants, artists and sitters and my family, who make the life-drawing sessions and these works possible.
