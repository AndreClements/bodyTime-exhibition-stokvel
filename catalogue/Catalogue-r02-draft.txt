bodyTime(fugitivity) 

Introduction 

In a small Randburg studio, every second weekend, artists gather—novices to masters—all tracing bodies in quiet focus. A soft 
“How’s everyone?” fills the air, grounding life-drawing that pares humanness bare—flesh poised, breath caught, doubled in 
two exposures. bodyTime() skims time’s edge—neither locked nor lost—skin tracing a toe’s reach, a hand’s drift, a veil’s bend. 
Pareidolia glints: what’s there, what’s not, shimmers in the overlap. 

At Stokvel Gallery, Melville, 15 to 16 March 2025, André Clements offers 16 prints—each a body folding into itself, sharp yet soft. 
No fixed frame pins them; every curve dares a quiet yes—steady, then gone. Here, they’re finite, rare, raw. Step in; meet the 
glimmer where presence bends its shadow play. 


20241101_1 

A toe teeters at the frame’s edge, taut, twisting—its arch flares, slicing through shadow to graze an armpit’s dip. Wrinkles 
ripple up an ankle, brushing a neck’s faint tilt, then ease downward, meeting flesh that holds steady where the foot strains. Toe 
traces a line to a distant curve—nipple, a silent tie across the span. 

No neat frame binds it; tension hums between the lean reach and the body’s grounded weight—a spark of motion tipping 
against stillness, articulation testing what’s whole. Light bends soft across the overlap, shadow pooling where edges blur—a 
form caught mid-shift, alive, elusive. 

Step closer; bear the invitation.

20241101_2 (Elbow) 

An elbow juts, bending shadow across a breast’s curve—upper arm stretched, fine hair glinting in the Canon 5DSR’s crisp 
gaze. No blur here; every strand catches light, a quiet testament to flesh meeting lens. The breast rests, steady, where the arm 
angles—less a clash, more a crossing, like lines on a map half-drawn. 

No pose holds still; the overlap shifts—arm guarding or reaching, breast simply there, a tension that’s soft, not strained. Light 
pools, then spills, carving edges where hair prickles against smooth skin. It’s raw, close—yet pulls back, a form caught in mid-
thought, mid-breath. 

In bodyTime()’s triptych, it follows the toe’s twist—here, the elbow turns the page. Not loud, not lush—just real. 
Step closer; trace the grain.

20241101_3 (Third in Triptych) 

A hand rests—or drifts—fragile veins tracing whispers beneath skin, hovering over the body’s quiet sweep. A light-curve lifts 
from a belly-button’s neat slit to a nipple’s soft peak, etching a vesica piscis in shadow. Below, the pubic delta stirs, half-shielded 
by the hand’s faint arc—protective, seeking, unanswered. 

Time folds here: double-exposure sinks belly into softness, pubis rooting it still. Curves melt into shadow, lines yielding to 
quiet. Veins, barely there, sketch maps without claim—echoes of touch too light to grasp. The hand bridges nipple to delta, a 
tender thread of doubt. 

In bodyTime()’s triptych, it seals the arc—toe’s pull, elbow’s edge, now hand’s grace. 
Step closer; feel its quiet gravity.

20231201_3 (Dancer II BW) 

A dancer hovers—still, yet stirring—her doubled form unfurls from soft repose into motion. Skin skirts light, tracing a quiet 
arc where shadow bends, as if time stumbles—neither fully here nor gone, a breath snagged mid-turn. 

No moment traps her; she’s a spark between then and next. Gravity tugs, then slips, threading a texture—real, yet fading. A 
living trace eludes the frame. The glow drifts, unhurried, easing us into a pause like memory, motion hushed for now. 

She dances without sound—her glance a quiet call, her becoming a shadow cast. 
Stay with it—dance with the dark and with the light.

20231203_III (iHubmyOfferTheCandleThatIsn’tThere) 

Two exposures softly align—a figure seated upright, facing forward, and reclining, head tilting toward us. Her hands, clasped 
prayer-like yet light, converge in quiet meditation, birthing an illusory candle—a gentle artifact flickering between poses. 
This phantom glow, unlit yet present, emerges from the tender overlap of inward stillness and outward offering, a whisper of 
illumination that never fully forms. 

Beads and bracelets ground her in embodiment, while the candle’s mirage lifts it beyond—hinting at the unseen, the relational, 
the fleeting. In bodyTime(), this work reflects meaning’s quiet dance: not fixed in objects, but born where authenticity 
meets vulnerability, where consent lets presence shine softly. It’s a contemplative pause—echoing Nussbaum’s gentle gaze, 
Khayyám’s shadows—inviting us to see not what’s forced, but what’s allowed to drift into view, delicate and true.

20241005_1 [Still to update text and or title] 

This layered composition captures a profound intimacy, blending facial and bodily forms into a unified yet fragmented 
presence. The closed eyes of the subject evoke introspection and stillness, while the overlapping contours of arms and torso 
create a sense of quiet containment, as though the figure is holding both themselves and the viewer in an embrace. 

The dual perspectives—face and body—merge to suggest an interplay of vulnerability and strength. The textures of skin, 
subtle details like a piercing, and the faint hint of tattooed lines emphasize individuality while dissolving boundaries between 
inner and outer experience. The grayscale palette heightens the tactile and emotional resonance of the work, offering a 
moment suspended between reflection and connection. 

As part of bodyTime(fugitivity), this piece explores themes of self-possession and relationality. The layering implies the simultaneity 
of being both seen and unseen, whole yet multifaceted. It invites the viewer to consider how touch, gaze, and memory 
shape identity, rendering the body not as a fixed object but as a vessel of layered experiences and meanings.

20240810_1 

This composition captures a dynamic tension between rest and motion, layering bodies to create a sense of fragmented, 
overlapping temporality. The figure’s gaze, directed outward yet introspective, contrasts with the fluidity of limbs and torsos 
intertwined through the composition. The layering of forms evokes a dialogue between the body as an object of stillness and 
as a site of continuous becoming. 

The interplay of light and shadow emphasizes the contours and musculature, while the translucent overlaps suggest movement 
caught mid-transition, as though multiple perspectives of a single moment coexist. The positioning of the figures—poised yet 
relaxed—creates an ambiguous narrative that feels both intimate and distant. 

Within bodyTime(fugitivity), this piece explores the relational complexity of self-awareness and embodiment. The composition 
invites the viewer to consider the body not as a fixed entity but as a series of layered impressions, shaped by time, touch, 
and gaze. It holds a quiet yet striking presence, speaking to the transient nature of being and the intersections of identity and 
perception.

20231110_1 [Still to update text and or title] 

This composition balances duality and convergence, layering the nude figure in a way that both fragments and integrates its 
form. The central figure, upright and illuminated, becomes the focal point, while the shadowy contours of the background 
figure anchor the composition in a broader spatial dialogue. The hands, delicately placed, frame the body with a quiet tension, 
suggesting both containment and openness. 

The interplay between light and shadow emphasizes the softness of the flesh while introducing a sculptural quality to the 
figure. The layering creates a subtle distortion, where the subject becomes both singular and plural, embodying multiple 
moments and perspectives simultaneously. The result is a body that feels both grounded in physical reality and suspended in 
an abstract temporality. 

As part of bodyTime(fugitivity), this piece speaks to the complexity of identity and embodiment. The body, presented in 
overlapping states, suggests a negotiation between presence and absence, the tangible and the transient. The composition 
invites the viewer to reflect on the layered nature of being, where the self is continually shaped by movement, memory, and 
perception.

20240505_2 [Still to update text and or title] 

This composition intertwines light and shadow, where cascading hair and delicate wrinkles intersect to form a trail of life’s 
unfolding—like sparks suspended in slow motion, yet imbued with a quiet darkness. The flowing hair, luminous and soft, 
contrasts with the stillness of the face, creating a tension between motion and restraint. This interplay evokes time’s dual 
nature: as both fleeting and weighty, a gentle passage that leaves indelible marks. 

The layered contours of expression feel intimate yet elusive, as if the subject is caught between reflection and concealment. 
The necklaces, draped like strands of memory, anchor the piece in materiality, their beads resonating with the rhythmic pulse 
of time. Yet amidst this layering of light and texture lies a subtle heaviness, a darkness that lingers in the spaces between 
presence and absence. 

Within bodyTime(fugitivity), this work captures not just the beauty of time’s traces but also its shadows—the emotional 
weight carried within each moment. It reflects on the fragility of identity and the inevitability of change, inviting the viewer to 
confront the layered complexities of existence, where light and darkness are inseparable.

20240922_1 (Folds) [Still to update text and or title] 

This piece captures the human form as a study in curves and layers, where the folding of limbs and the interplay of overlapping 
contours evoke a sense of enclosed intimacy. The body, partially obscured and fragmented, becomes a terrain of texture and 
light, its curves inviting yet elusive. The tattoo etched into the skin punctuates the composition, an anchor of individuality 
within the abstraction. 

The layering of forms softens the boundaries of the body, transforming it into a flowing rhythm of lines and shadows. The folds 
of the figure echo the folds of fabric beneath, blurring distinctions between the subject and its surrounding environment. The 
result is a meditative exploration of enclosure—both physical and emotional—where vulnerability is offered and concealed 
in equal measure. 

As part of bodyTime(fugitivity), this piece highlights the transient and relational nature of embodiment. The layered folds 
suggest moments of protection and surrender, inviting the viewer to reflect on the interplay between self-containment and 
connection. It is a quiet yet potent reminder of the body’s dual role as both a boundary and a bridge.

20241103_1 (Reach) [Still to update text and or title] 

This composition constitutes a complex interplay of introspection and outward motion, where the figure’s direct gaze contrasts 
with the layered, fragmented forms of the body. The subject’s chest and arm stretch across the frame, creating a gesture that 
feels simultaneously vulnerable and assertive. The layering of profiles and shadows introduces a dialogue between presence 
and reflection, where the act of reaching extends beyond the physical to the emotional and symbolic. 

The intersection of the eye with the sharp line of the shoulder subtly evokes a visual tension reminiscent of Un Chien Andalou. 
This implicit reference to the surrealist slicing of perception deepens the work’s layered exploration of vulnerability, self-possession, 
and dissolution. The fractured eye—a locus of seeing and being seen—speaks to the recurring tension of the fragmented 
self within the composition. 

Within bodyTime(fugitivity), this piece engages the act of reaching as a metaphor for relationality and self-discovery. The 
gesture extends outward yet folds back into itself, suggesting that reaching involves both connection and exposure. The work 
draws the viewer into the space where bodies, fragmented and layered, navigate the shifting boundaries between interiority 
and outward offering.

20240907_01 

This composition layers bodies in a gesture of grounding and intimacy, where the central figure’s hands rest gently on their 
own form, creating a connection that feels deeply self-reflective yet relational. The framing emphasizes the symmetry and 
rhythm of limbs, with overlapping forms producing a softened interplay of vulnerability and strength. The downward gaze of 
the figure suggests contemplation, their pose both open and inwardly held. 

The layering of legs and hands introduces an ambiguity of positions, blurring the distinction between singular and shared 
presence. The folds of the fabric beneath the bodies mirror this multiplicity, creating a sense of undulating motion beneath 
the stillness of the composition. The grayscale tones further abstract the forms, shifting attention toward the interplay of 
shapes and the emotional resonance of touch. 

Within bodyTime(fugitivity), this piece reflects on the body as a site of connection—not only between individuals but within 
the self. The gesture of hands meeting the torso evokes both reassurance and an invitation, a quiet assertion of presence 
amidst the flux of layered moments. It invites the viewer into a space where the body becomes both anchor and question, 
holding time and touch in dynamic balance.

20241117_2 (Veil of Folds) 

A back arcs, arms braced at its sides—steady, carved, poised. Through it, a chest glints—angled, arms splaying in a breath’s 
faint echo. A veil of light and texture cuts across—skin’s ridge or fabric’s ghost, a trace of what was. The body hovers, neither 
whole nor split, alive in its merge and fade. 

Flesh grazes shadow—muscles taut, then fleeting. Shoulder blade juts, hip creases sink—contours flare where time folds in 
cascading locks. The second figure, softer, haunts within—ribs rising through the veil, gaze heavy, unseen. 

Solidity bends, then slips—form giving way to apparition. 
Let the veil shift.

20240113-20240922_1 [Still to update text and or title and produce 
B&W version] 

This composition intertwines sensuality and dissonance, layering fragmented forms into an intricate interplay of skin, texture, 
and shadow. The seated figure, framed by overlapping planes, evokes both vulnerability and power, as though caught between 
states of presence and dissolution. The faintly visible second face, partially obscured, deepens the image’s complexity, suggesting 
a dialogue between inner and outer selves. 

The muted palette, punctuated by moments of rich color, lends a tactile quality to the image, where flesh and shadow 
converge into a rhythm of contrasts. Jewelry and subtle adornments draw attention to the body’s contours while grounding 
the ethereal layering in the material world. This balance of the physical and the abstract transforms the body into both subject 
and medium, carrying the marks of movement, time, and gaze. 

Within bodyTime(fugitivity), this piece captures the tension between intimacy and abstraction. It invites the viewer to confront 
the multiplicity of the body as a site of beauty, memory, and transformation. The layered composition resists singular interpretation, 
instead creating a dynamic space where embodiment becomes an open question, alive with ambiguity and resonance.

20241116_2 [Still to update text and or title] 

This composition brings focus to the tactile and intimate, layering hands and torso into an interplay of curves and gestures. 
The overlapping forms create a rhythm that blurs distinctions between movement and stillness, presenting the body as both 
whole and fragmented. The hands, delicately resting, suggest comfort and introspection, grounding the piece in a moment 
of quiet presence. 

The soft gradients of light and shadow emphasize the contours of the skin, giving depth to the layered forms. Subtle scars and 
textures add individuality, contrasting with the abstraction created by the layering. The repetition of shapes evokes the cyclical 
nature of touch, time, and self-perception, turning the body into a site of memory and transformation. 

As part of bodyTime(fugitivity), this work reflects on the layered complexity of embodiment, where the body becomes a space 
of both vulnerability and resilience. It invites the viewer to engage with the overlapping narratives etched into flesh, exploring 
how touch and time inscribe meaning onto the physical self. The result is a meditation on presence—both grounded and 
transient, intimate and universal.

20240712_20250118_1 (Bending Diamonds) 

Two moments softly meet—one distant, arms folding gentle against black; the other near, a far hand brushing a close ear. A 
diamond’s light bends through—faint from a mouth’s edge, firm across a bicep—fragile, sharp, threading a quiet pull. 

Not all shield, not all bare—skin maps a whisper where inner folds graze outer lines. The gaze holds—steady, soft, daring in its 
drift—neither giving nor guarding full. Presence curls inward, then out, a gesture snagged mid-breath. 

It glimmers—bending diamonds of stance and gaze. 
Step closer; find your reflection in its way.

Artist Statement 
bodyTime(fugitivity) : 

An exploration of presence, of bodies between stillness and being. 

Each image layers two moments, reflecting the elusive essence of being seen, of passing through time while holding the marks of 
movement, touch, and gaze, of life. 

Advance Praise 

You give the viewer an opportunity to view the model from several points of view; clearly, it takes time to look at anything or anyone from 
different angles in different poses, so you present that opportunity to the viewer. Wonderfully anachronistic, showing us glimpses in blackand-
white that remind us of Duchamp’s “nude descending a staircase”, Balla’s futurism, Boccioni’s “Unique forms of continuity in Space” and 
Edweard Muybridge’s Studies in motion.

...everything about these are quite something . The overlayed exposures take me into an imaginary surreal erotic world. Controversial 
french psychologist, (post Freud) Jacques Lacan comes to mind.
