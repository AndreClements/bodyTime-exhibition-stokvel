# Introduction

In a small Randburg studio, every second weekend, artists gather—novices to masters—all tracing bodies in quiet focus. A soft “How’s everyone?” fills the air, grounding life-drawing that pares humanness bare—flesh poised, breath caught, doubled in two exposures. *bodyTime()* skims time’s edge—neither locked nor lost—skin tracing a toe’s reach, a hand’s drift, a veil’s bend. Pareidolia glints: what’s there, what’s not, shimmers in the overlap.

At Stokvel Gallery, Melville, 15 to 16 March 2025, André Clements offers 16 prints—each a body folding into itself, sharp yet soft. No fixed frame pins them; every curve dares a quiet yes—steady, then gone. Beyond, they live in the Creative Commons and on GitHub (*bodyTime-exhibition-stokvel*), but here, they’re finite, rare, raw. Step in; meet the glimmer where presence bends its shadow play.
