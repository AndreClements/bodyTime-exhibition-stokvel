# bodyTime() Catalogue Outro

These bodies linger—neither still nor fleeing, doubled in light and shadow. A triptych threads toe to hand, a dancer drifts, diamonds bend, veils fold—each a gesture caught mid-breath, testing time’s skin. From *fugitivity*’s Sex Expo spark (November 2024) to Stokvel’s walls, they whisper: presence isn’t fixed; it shifts where edges graze.

“Wonderfully anachronistic… Duchamp’s nude descending,” observes Carl Jeppe; Anton Uys feels “an imaginary surreal world,” Lacan’s echo in the blur. Here, 16 prints shimmer—finite in form, free beyond. Not objects, not answers—just flesh folding into its own quiet dare, inviting a gaze to pause and bend.

Behind it all, Gordon Froud’s Stokvel holds space; Sammy Muller’s voice opens it. Step past; carry the shift.
