These bodies linger—neither still nor fleeing, doubled in light and shadow. A triptych threads toe to hand (*20241101_1-3*), a dancer drifts (*20231201_3*), diamonds bend (*20240712_20250118_1*), veils fold (*20241117_2*)—each a gesture caught mid-breath, testing time’s skin. From *fugitivity*’s Sex Expo spark (November 2024) to Stokvel’s walls, they whisper: presence isn’t fixed; it shifts where edges graze.

“Wonderfully anachronistic… Duchamp’s nude descending,” observes Carl Jeppe; Anton Uys feels “an imaginary surreal world,” Lacan’s echo in the blur. Here, 16 prints shimmer—finite in form. Not objects, not answers—just flesh folding into its own quiet dare, inviting a gaze to pause and bend.

Behind it all, Gordon Froud’s Stokvel holds space; Sammy Muller’s voice opens it. Step past; carry the shift.
