A small group gathers in my studio for a few hours. It's been this way regularly since  2017: just a handful of artists and a someone who will pose, sometimes friends, sometimes strangers, all sorts of bodies, all sorts of lives. We begin not by drawing, not by positioning, but by checking in gently: "How's everyone today?"—model included, always. There's a moment of quiet recognition, simple consent to share this space. No assumptions, no roles forced upon anyone—just a soft yes, freely given, freely received.

In that moment, something quietly shifts. Layers of everyday pretense soften and dissolve. We move gently into presence—no forcing, no pushing, just being there, together. Time slows; the body settles. This gentle space is about more than art—it's a subtle invitation to authenticity, to vulnerability offered without exposure, to honesty emerging not from pressure but from permission.

That's where *bodyTime()* begins. Not as an abstract idea, nor some grand claim to absolute truth, but simply as an extension of these weekly encounters, this familiar, shared humanness. *bodyTime()* quietly carries that same energy into a collection of gentle black-and-white double-exposure photographs, softly layered, shown briefly at Stokvel Gallery in Melville, just for two days (March 15–16, 2025). Each piece is priced playfully at R3,333.33—not market logic, just shapes and curves that feel right.

But more deeply, *bodyTime()* offers something else—a gentle exploration of how we meet each other and ourselves, how we handle power, how we say yes to vulnerability without becoming victims or heroes or saviours. This space we create each week through life-drawing—soft, consensual, honest—quietly opposes the noisy, often hidden drama of everyday interactions. That exhausting cycle of victimhood, blame, and forced rescue—what psychologists call the Karpman Drama Triangle—is diffused simply by our careful consent. No one takes power from another here. Power is never truly shared, only taken or relinquished—but here we invite each other softly to take only our own power, no more, no less.

Vulnerability within consent becomes something gently profound. The difference between vulnerability freely offered and vulnerability taken is subtle but essential. Without consent, vulnerability becomes mere exposure, harsh and unsafe. But within clear, quiet consent, vulnerability opens softly, beautifully, honestly. It becomes safe precisely because it is freely chosen. This is the gentle thread running through *bodyTime()*: consent as the quiet heartbeat that makes honesty safe, makes vulnerability beautiful, makes authenticity possible.

Honesty, in this space, quietly dismantles the drama that often dominates life. No pretense, no masks, no hurried performance. It becomes integrity—a quiet resistance, gentle defiance against a louder world often built on domination and coercion. This integrity aligns softly with my broader Vita-Socio-Anarco ethos, which values life, community, and non-domination over control, profit, or forced outcomes. Integrity isn't moral superiority; it's a quiet choice—sometimes successful, sometimes failing, always striving toward authenticity.

This gentle rebellion shows itself subtly in the consistent pricing of my work—always R3,333.33, an absurdity designed to undermine the art market's insistence on seriousness. It's playfulness, quiet defiance, a softly spoken resistance. Stokvel Gallery echoes this ethos perfectly. Founded by Gordon Froud, it's artist-run, commission-free, raw walls, simple lights—nothing grandiose, no hidden agendas. It mirrors the quiet humility of the life-drawing space, a gentle invitation extended to everyone equally, softly, honestly.

But *bodyTime()* also invites us to reconsider the way we see, the way we look. Philosopher Martha Nussbaum offers the nuanced possibility of non-pathological objectification—a respectful gaze, intimate yet non-invasive, possible only with clear consent. Consider images like 20241101_1—a foot, a breast softly dissolving—or (Dancer) 20231201_1—a dancer suspended gently between stillness and movement. The gaze in these works isn't about possession, but quiet recognition. Intimacy without invasion, openness without forced exposure. Consent, again, makes this gentle exchange possible.

Gender freedom subtly emerges here too, quietly dismantling rigid stereotypes. Life-drawing, *bodyTime()*, and the spaces around them intentionally reject binary assumptions or fixed roles. Bodies are simply bodies; people simply people. Everyone steps forward as themselves, without needing permission to be anything other than what they naturally, softly, authentically are. There's no loud activism here—just quiet inclusion, subtle equality, gentle openness.

All of this—consent, vulnerability, honesty, integrity, quiet resistance, respectful looking—leads gently to the recognition of life's inherent transience, the shadow play described by Omar Khayyám. The body, illuminated briefly by life's candle, casts shadows that flicker softly across walls. Beingness drifts quietly through moments we never fully grasp. In *bodyTime()*, nothing is claimed or fixed—only gently offered, fleetingly held. It's a humble recognition that the map we've drawn—this treatise, these photographs—is never the territory itself. Every map is simply a territory—provisional, incomplete, but real enough to feel and explore.

My role as an artist, facilitator, and photographer is intentionally minimal, a "light-touch" process. I don't direct; I gently invite. I create spaces, not outcomes, because outcomes are never fully ours to control. We strive quietly, humbly, sometimes successfully, sometimes falling short—but the artistry lies in this honest striving. It's not perfection we seek, but the gentle courage to say yes, to take our own power without imposing upon others.

Ultimately, *bodyTime()* doesn't promise certainty—only possibility. It's an invitation to stand quietly in our authenticity, gently claim our own power, accept vulnerability, reject drama, and embrace integrity. It reminds us softly that we are transient, shadows briefly cast upon a wall, phantom spirits quietly illuminated, each for a brief moment saying yes.

In the end, perhaps all we can truly offer is this quiet yes—a soft, humble invitation to meet each other honestly, vulnerably, briefly, before the candle dims and shadows fade. To gently claim our own power, no more, no less. To stand simply as we are—openly, gently, authentically—together.

And then, quietly, let go.
