# bodyTime() Exhibition Repository  
**by André Clements**

**Dates:** March 15–16, 2025  
**Venue:** Stokvel Gallery, 27 Boxes, Melville, Johannesburg  

## Overview  
*bodyTime()* is an intimate exhibition featuring black-and-white double-exposure photographs that gently explore embodiment, vulnerability, consent, and the ethics of saying "yes."

Inspired by regular life-drawing sessions, philosophical insights from Martha Nussbaum, and the poetic reflections of Omar Khayyám, the exhibition softly challenges viewers to reconsider presence, honesty, and vulnerability through consensual intimacy.

## Exhibition Concept  
> “In and out, above about, below—  
> it’s all nothing more than a magic shadow show  
> in a box whose candle is the sun,  
> ‘round which we phantom spirits  
> come and go.”  
> —after Omar Khayyám  

*bodyTime()* explores two interconnected realities: **embodiment** (the tangible, physical presence) and **beingness** (our transient, shadow-like existence). These layers quietly coexist in each photograph, briefly displayed over two days.

At its core is **consent**—a freely given "yes," fundamental and necessary. Consent transforms vulnerability into beauty rather than mere exposure. This aligns with a personal philosophy—**Vita-Socio-Anarco**—emphasizing life, community, and freedom from domination. The works are playfully priced at R3,333.33 and exhibited without pretension at the artist-run Stokvel Gallery.

### Core Themes  
- **Consent:** Freely given, foundational.
- **Vulnerability:** Beauty through openness, never coercion.
- **Honesty:** Genuine presence without pretense.
- **Integrity:** Life, community, non-domination.
- **Playful Pricing:** Consistent absurdity challenging market logic (R3,333.33).
- **Karpman Triangle:** Quietly dismantling coercive drama through honesty.
- **Non-pathological Objectification:** Respectful, consensual viewing (Martha Nussbaum).
- **Gender Freedom:** Inclusive of all identities, free from stereotypes.
- **Light-Touch Process:** Minimal intervention, maximum autonomy.
- **Fleetingness:** Reflecting life's ephemeral nature (Omar Khayyám).
