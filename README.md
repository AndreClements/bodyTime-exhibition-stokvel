# bodyTime() Exhibition Repository
by André Clements

**Dates**: March 15–16, 2025  
**Venue**: Stokvel Gallery, 27 Boxes, Melville, Johannesburg  

## Overview
*bodyTime()* is an intimate, philosophical, and gently subversive exhibition—black-and-white double-exposure photographs, each uniquely printed, exploring embodiment, vulnerability, consent, and the quiet ethics of saying "yes."  

Drawing inspiration from weekly life-drawing sessions, the philosophical nuances of Martha Nussbaum, the poetic shadows of Omar Khayyám, and resisting coercive cycles described in the Karpman Drama Triangle, this exhibition softly challenges the viewer to reconsider what it means to be truly present, honest, and vulnerable through the gentle invitation of consensual intimacy.

## Exhibition Concept
> “In and out, above about, below—  
> it’s all nothing more than a magic shadow show  
> in a box whose candle is the sun,  
> ‘round which we phantom spirits  
> come and go.”  
> —after Omar Khayyám  

*bodyTime()* gently holds two fleeting truths—embodiment (the physicality of being alive, softly exposed) and beingness (the ephemeral, shadow-like nature of existence). These truths don’t compete but layer quietly, reflected in soft black-and-white double exposures exhibited briefly for only two days.  

At heart is consent—a yes freely offered, quietly foundational. Consent turns vulnerability into something profound, transforming openness into beauty rather than exposure. Integrity emerges here, aligned with my Vita-Socio-Anarco philosophy, resisting coercion gently, playfully priced at R3,333.33, and exhibited without pretension at artist-run Stokvel Gallery, Melville, Johannesburg.

### Core Themes
- **Consent**: Freely given, ethically essential, foundational.  
- **Vulnerability**: Beauty through voluntary openness, never coercion.  
- **Honesty**: Quiet presence without pretense.  
- **Integrity**: Vita-Socio-Anarco—life, sociality, non-domination.  
- **Playful Pricing**: Consistent absurdity, resisting market-driven logic (R3,333.33).  
- **Karpman Triangle**: Drama and coercion quietly dismantled through honesty.  
- **Non-pathological Objectification**: Inspired by Martha Nussbaum—looking gently, respectfully, with consent.  
- **Gender Freedom**: Any body, any gender—no stereotypes or forced identities.  
- **Light-Touch Process**: Minimal intervention, maximum autonomy.  
- **Fleetingness**: Life’s shadow-play, inspired by Omar Khayyám’s philosophy.
